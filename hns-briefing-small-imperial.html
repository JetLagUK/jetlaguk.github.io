    <h1>Hide and Seek Briefing (Small Games)</h1>
<p>Hide and Seek is a game where the hiders try to hide in a hiding zone, and the seekers try to find them as quickly as possible. The seekers
ask questions from a set list of allowed questions, which the hiders must answer truthfully. As a reward for answering, the hiders draw
cards from a deck which may be used to benefit themselves or slow down the seekers. After each round, the roles rotate, with the new hiders
finding a new location to hide in. At the end of the game, the team who has hidden the longest without being found wins.</p>
<h2>Before You Start</h2>
<p>Before you arrive, bring a power bank, as you will be using your phone a lot and your battery will drain fast, especially if you have the
tracker enabled. Also bring a water bottle, and a packed lunch if you are planning on hiding somewhere rural without shops or restaurants.</p>
<p>Both the hiders and the seekers need at least one person sharing their location with the helpdesk, whose gmail address is
<code>jetlaglondon@gmail.com</code>. One person from the seekers team also needs to share their location with at least one person from the hiders team.
This hider needs to provide their email to the seeker in DMs. To share your location:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Google Maps.</li>
<li>Tap your profile in the top right of your screen.</li>
<li>Tap &quot;location sharing&quot;.</li>
<li>Press &quot;new share&quot;.</li>
<li>Press the &quot;+&quot; button next to where it says &quot;for 1 hour&quot;, until the time is increased such that you're sharing until the end of the game.
We do not recommend clicking &quot;until you turn this off&quot;, as you may forget to turn it off and then you could end up sharing where you live.</li>
<li>Under &quot;sugggestions&quot;, scroll all the way to the right and click &quot;more&quot;.</li>
<li>Type in the gmail address of who you want to share with, and then click on them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Game Cycle</h2>
<h3>Hiding Period</h3>
<p>The hiders choose a transit stop on which to centre their hiding zone. Depending on the game map you're playing, the &quot;transit stop&quot; may be
a bus stop, a tram stop, a train station, or any one of these. The &quot;hiding zone&quot; is a ¼ mile radius circle centred on the
transit stop. During the hiding period, the hiders have  to travel to their transit stop using any allowed means of
transport, during which time the seekers are frozen at the start location.</p>
<h3>Middle Game</h3>
<p>During the middle game, the hiders may freely move anywhere within their hiding zone. Their job during this period is to answer questions
from the seekers, take photos in preparation for photo questions, and explore the zone for a hiding spot for the endgame.</p>
<p>The seekers will use this time to ask questions to narrow down the possible zones the hiders could be in. After each question, the hiders
will draw a number of cards from the deck, and choose some of them to keep in their hand. The number of cards they draw and choose depends
on the type of question asked.</p>
<h3>End Game</h3>
<p>The end game begins when the seekers enter the hiding zone <em>and</em> step off public transit if they were on it. The end game will begin even if
the seekers do not know they are in the hiding zone. When the end game starts, the hiders must freeze in their current location, called the
&quot;hiding spot&quot;. During the end game, the hiders cannot use any prepared photos for photo questions, and must take all photos anew as they are
asked.</p>
<p>If the seekers leave the zone during the end game, the end game does not pause or stop. If the seekers leave the zone during the endgame for
an excessive period of time, the helpdesk may allow the hiders to stretch their legs and move around a bit, but all questions must be
answered as if they are still stuck in the same spot.</p>
<p>The seekers will continue asking questions to narrow down the hiding spot during the endgame. The round ends when the seekers know where the
hiders are, and are within 5 feet of them.</p>
<h3>Rotating Rounds</h3>
<p>Once found, the hiders' total time will be the time between when the seekers were released and when they were found, plus any time bonus
cards they have, plus or minus any time penalties given by the helpdesk for either team accidentally breaking the rules.</p>
<p>All players travel back to the starting point of the map to start the next round. They exchange equipment as necessary (e.g. the old hiders
give the new hiders the card deck), and switch up the trackers so that the new hiders can see the new seekers' location, and the new seekers
can't see the new hiders' location.</p>
<h2>Hiding</h2>
<p>During the hiding period, you do not necessarily need to decide where your hiding zone is (although we would recommend planning it ahead of
time). If your hiding zone intersects the edge of the map (e.g. the edge of Luxembourg), you are also not allowed to leave the map.</p>
<p>In the middle game it is important to anticipate in advance possible photo questions that the seekers could ask, and take photos for them
early on. This is so that you are more free to move around the zone in the middle game without constantly rushing to photo locations, and
more importantly so that you aren't stuck needing to travel to a photo locaion right before the end game.</p>
<h3>Answering Questions</h3>
<p>You must answer all questions within 5 minutes of them being asked, or within 10 minutes for photo questions. We
recommend you start preparing the answer straight away, then wait for the majority of the time before sending the answer, so that the
seekers don't get a clue as to how easy the question was to answer, but not to wait too long in case something happens like your mobile data
cutting out for a minute.</p>
<p>When asked a question, you should check the rule book entry for that question to make sure that you answer it properly. After answering,
draw and pick the specified number of cards for that question category.</p>
<p>It is the seekers' responsibility to provide necessary information when asking a question. If the seekers fail to provide this, then ask for
the information rather than trying to work it out for yourself. See the rule book for the necessary information required to send for each
question.</p>
<p>All questions should be answered relative to the current location you are standing in when you send the answer, <em>not</em> the location of your
transit stop. In some cases it may be possible to move around within your zone to change the answer to the question; this is allowed as long
as you stay within the zone and answer the question within the time limit.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to answer the question, even given any amount of time, then you may answer &quot;null&quot; and still receive the reward for
answering the question. An example of a valid reason for answering &quot;null&quot; is that you could not reach the transit stop because you are in
the end game. You may not answer &quot;null&quot; just because you are too far away, instead you should answer the question late and receive the
penalty for doing so.</p>
<!-- Will move this to the rule book

When answering questions involving distance, use the measuring tool on Google Maps, and not some other measuring tool, to ensure that you
get a standardized answer that the seekers can interpret correctly. If you are comparing two distances and they appear the same on Google
Maps, ask helpdesk for a more precise measurement. For radar questions, see the following table:

Radar Size         | Answer "hit" when      | Answer "miss" when
-------------------|------------------------|------------------------
¼ mile | 0.2mi | 0.3mi
½ mile | 0.5mi | 0.6mi
1 mile | 1.0mi | 1.1mi
3 miles | 3.0mi | 3.1mi
5 miles | 5.0mi | 5.1mi
10 miles | 10mi | 11mi
25 miles | 25mi | 26mi
50 miles | 50mi | 51mi
100 miles | 100mi | 101mi

<h3>Using Cards</h3>
<p>There are three types of card:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time bonuses</strong> are added to your total hiding time at the end of the round.</li>
<li><strong>Power ups</strong> benefit you in some way, such as discard 1 draw 2, and increasing the size of your hand.</li>
<li><strong>Curses</strong> slow down the seekers in some way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Time bonuses must be kept until the end of the round to be applied. Power ups and curses can be played at any time, unless otherwise
specified. Your default hand size is 6 unless expanded by the hand size power up. If you ever get more cards than your hand size, you must
immediately use or discard some cards until you are down to the hand size again.</p>
<p>Curses often have a casting cost, which must be applied before sending the seekers the curse.</p>
<p>A full list of cards is available in the rule book.</p>
<h2>Seeking</h2>
<p>When asking questions, it is your responsibility to provide precise enough information to make sure that you can interpret the answer in the
same way that the hiders did when providing it. Check the rule book for details about how to ask each question and how to interpret the
answer, before asking the question. In general though, precise information may include coordinates of your current location (as your tracker
may be inaccurate or out of date), and a screenshot of all the points of interest (e.g. parks) your Google Maps is showing you.</p>
<p>While seeking, you may find it helpful to narrow down the hiders' location using the
<a href="https://taibeled.github.io/JetLagHideAndSeek/">JetLag map generator</a>.</p>
<h2>Other Rules to know about</h2>
<ul>
<li>Both the seekers and the hiders may only use public transport of the type specified by the game map.</li>
<li>Both the seekers and the hiders must stay in the game map at all times.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<h3>Forgetting to draw cards</h3>
<p>Don't forget to draw cards after answering a question!</p>
<h3>Forgetting to apply the casting cost of a curse</h3>
<p>Every time you play a curse, <strong>check the casting cost in bold at the bottom</strong>! Forgetting to do this may give you an unfair advantage.</p>
<h3>Not interpreting the answer to radar questions correctly</h3>
<p>Due to the impreciseness of Google Maps' measuring tool, the actual radius you should draw is not the same as the radius specified in the
question. A full table of actual radiuses to draw is in radar questions section in the rule book.</p>
<h3>Forgetting about radar dodging</h3>
<p>Remember that if they're lucky, during the middle game the hiders can move around within their zone to deliberately change the answer to
your question! This is called &quot;radar dodging&quot;, and you should take this into account when looking at the map of zones; even if the transit
stop itself would miss a radar, they may move somewhere where the radar is a hit. Radar dodging doesn't only apply to radars, it can happen
with any question which relies on the hiders' precise location. It's even possible for the entire map to appear to be ruled out on the map
generator: this can happen when the hiders have answered different questions in different locations.</p>
